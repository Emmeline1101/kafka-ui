## 1. Intro and Overview

### 1.1 Intro to UI for Apache Kafka

`Kafka UI` is an open-source web application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for the management and monitoring of Apache Kafka clusters. It enables users to navigate through topics, view cluster status, inspect consumer groups, configure settings, and more, without the need to interact directly with the underlying details of the Kafka cluster.[[1]](https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui)

### 1.2 Technical Overview

- Frontend:
  The Kafka UI project employs `TypeScript` and `React` framework, adopting a single-page application (SPA) model for UI construction. `TypeScript` use emphasizes type safety and error management during development.

- Backend:
  The backend programming language is `Java`, used with the `Spring Boot` framework to manage server-side logic, database interactions, and communication with Kafka. It conforms to a microservices architecture, supporting independent deployment and scaling of services.

- Project Management and Build Tools:
  The project utilizes `Maven` as its project management and build tool, demonstrating strict control over dependency management and build processes, ensuring consistency in builds and efficiency in project maintenance.

### 1.3 Code Overview

According to the statistics generated by the cloc tool on Linux, the Kafka UI project encompasses a multitude of programming languages, detailed as follows:

- `TypeScript` is the primary programming language of the project, consisting of 6,481 files and 325,842 lines of code, indicating the significance of the front-end component.
- `JSON` is employed for configuration files and data interchange, with 1,810 files comprising 248,555 lines of code.
- `Markdown` is utilized for documentation, represented by 1,330 files, signifying well-maintained project documentation.
- `Java` is used for backend logic, with 416 files and 35,370 lines of code, serving as the project's backend programming language.
- Languages such as `XML`, `Python`, `YAML`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and others are applied for configuration, scripting, and web page design.

The project also leverages a variety of scripting and configuration languages, including `Bourne Shell`, `Maven`, `Sass`, `ANTLR Grammar`, etc., demonstrating its multifaceted build and configuration management.

In total, the project possesses 27,946 files and 4,112,984 lines of code, displaying a vast and complex codebase that necessitates appropriate testing and maintenance strategies to ensure its robustness.

## 2.Setup & Build

### 2.1 Fork & Clone to the local machine

The first thing we did is to fork the project into our own repository. The original repository was at [https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui](https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui), which was shown below.

![Fig 1-2-1 Fork button](Fig/Untitled%201.png)

Fig 1-2-1 Fork button

We used the button as pointed by the red arrow to fork the project, then typed the command below to clone the project by Git into the local disk.

`git clone [https://github.com/mingxin0607/kafka-ui.git](https://github.com/mingxin0607/kafka-ui.git)`

### 2.2 Build & Run

After the operations above, we would like to open the project in an IDE and try to build the project. Our team use `IntelliJ IDEA` provided by JetBrain as IDE.

#### 2.2.1 Build & Run on macOS (Docker)

Initially, we operated on a macOS platform and utilized Docker to build and execute the project. To prepare our development environment, we verified the inclusion of the following tools:

- Java 17 package or newer(for Maven and Spring Boot backend)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend application)
- Docker (for container building and running)
- Maven (for building the project including the Kafka UI backend).

#### Step 1: Backend--Build Docker Image:
- Open terminal, navigate to the project root.
- Build the project including kafka-ui-api backend:
```shell
./mvnw clean install -Pprod
```
If skipping the tests:
```shell
./mvnw clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Pprod
```
To build only the kafka-ui-api:
```shell
./mvnw -f kafka-ui-api/pom.xml clean install -Pprod -DskipUIBuild=true
```
#### Step 2: Frontend:
- Navigate to frontend directory (e.g., kafka-ui-react-app).
- Install Dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
- Build Frontend Application:
```shell
npm run build
```
#### Step 3: Running the Project:
- Run with Docker Compose:
```shell
docker-compose -f ./documentation/compose/kafka-ui.yaml up -d
```
#### Step 4: Access Kafka UI:
- Once running, visit http://localhost:8080 in a browser.

#### 2.2.2 Build & Run on Ubuntu (Without Docker)

Then built and ran the project on Ubuntu, which is an open-source operating system based on Linux. This was done without using Docker, assuming that we had already installed the prerequisites and cloned the repository.

#### Method1: Quick Project Execution (Without Building JAR):

- To run Kafka UI quickly without manually building a JAR file, execute a pre-built JAR file with this command:
```shell
java -Dspring.config.additional-location=<path-to-application-local.yml> --add-opens java.rmi/javax.rmi.ssl=ALL-UNNAMED -jar <path-to-kafka-ui-jar>
```
Replace <path-to-application-local.yml> and <path-to-kafka-ui-jar> with actual file paths. Configure Kafka cluster details in application-local.yml.

#### Method2: Manual Build and Execution (Without Docker):
- Comment out the docker-maven-plugin in kafka-ui-api/pom.xml.
- Build the JAR file with Maven:
```shell
mvn clean install
```
- Locate the built JAR (kafka-ui-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) in kafka-ui-api/target.
- Run the JAR file using the aforementioned command.

### 2.3 Build Issue
1. After installing JDK 17, remember to switch the default Java version to the current one:
    - Use the following command to list all installed Java versions and their locations:
        
        ```bash
        /usr/libexec/java_home -V
        
        ```
        
    - Use the following command to configure the default Java version to JDK 17 (replace the path with your JDK 17 installation path):
        
        ```bash
        export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)
        
        ```
        
    - Update the `PATH` environment variable to ensure that the `bin` directory of JDK 17 comes before others:
        
        ```bash
        export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
        
        ```
        
    - Verify that the Java version has been switched to JDK 17:
        
        ```bash
        java -version
        
        ```
        
2. Check the versions of Node.js, npm, and Docker:
    
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    docker --version
    
    ```
    
3. macOS system version needs to match Docker. If you have macOS Catalina (10.15.7), you can refer to the following post to download Docker:
    
    [Install Docker on macOS Catalina](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68373008/install-docker-on-macos-catalina)
    
4. When using `npm install` to build the frontend application, you may need to:
    - Delete the existing `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file, then reinstall dependencies:
        
        ```bash
        rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
        
        npm install
        
        ```
        
    - Modify some dependency versions in `pom.xml`. I changed the following dependencies:
        
        `"vite": "^5.0.0"`
        
        `"@types/node": "^20.0.0"`
        
    - After resolving conflicts, execute:
        
        ```bash
        npm install
        
        ```
        
5. Confirm if Docker is running:
    
    ```bash
    docker ps
    
    ```
    
    If the 8080 port doesn't immediately redirect to the webpage, it might still be loading. Wait a bit longer, and the page should appear.

# Part II. Existing Test

## 2.1 Existing Testing Frameworks

The project primarily utilizes JUnit5, specified as **`**<junit.version>5.9.1</junit.version>**`**, as its core testing framework, complemented by additional tools to enhance testing capabilities:

- **Mockito** (**`<mockito.version>5.3.1</mockito.version>`**) is employed for mocking dependencies in unit tests, thus simplifying and ensuring their reliability.
- **Testcontainers** (**`<testcontainers.version>1.17.5</testcontainers.version>`**) provides a reusable testing environment that closely simulates production settings, enhancing the accuracy of integration tests.
- **Maven Surefire Plugin** (**`<maven-surefire-plugin.version>3.1.2</maven-surefire-plugin.version>`**) automates the testing workflow, including test discovery and execution, and generates detailed reports.

This integration of testing frameworks and tools not only boosts the efficiency and quality of Java project testing but also supports the development teams in achieving high-quality code standards through simplified unit testing, accurate integration testing, and streamlined test management.

## 2.2 Existing Testing Practices

The testing files are mainly restored in the path as below:

`kafka-ui/kafka-ui-api/src/test`

The  following description is around the main testing categories based on the project’s testing files.

### **Integration Testing**

- **AbstractIntegrationTest**: These tests ensure theintegration between the frontend React application and the Kafka backend. They validate that API calls for fetching Kafka topics, consumer groups, or managing message production and consumption are executed flawlessly. Additionally, they confirm the successful integration with other services like schema registries and Kafka Connect.

### **Service Testing**

- **BrokerServiceTest, TopicsServicePaginationTest**: These tests examine the business logic for interacting with Kafka brokers and topics. They confirm the application's capabilities to list, create, delete, and paginate through topics effectively. Furthermore, they guarantee accurate management of consumer groups and their offsets, alongside correct implementation of custom logic for Kafka's administrative functions.

### **Serde Testing**

- **Int32SerdeTest, AvroEmbeddedSerdeTest**: Serde tests ensure that messages are properly serialized for production into Kafka topics and deserialized upon consumption. They cover testing for various data formats, including Avro, Protobuf, integers, and strings, to ensure seamless compatibility and accuracy across Kafka clients and services.

### **Controller Testing**

- **ApplicationConfigControllerTest**: These tests rigorously validate the HTTP interfaces provided by the backend, ensuring that REST API endpoints respond precisely as intended. They confirm that requests to these endpoints yield the correct status codes, headers, and body content, and accurately process request parameters for operations like fetching or updating configuration details.

### **Utility Class Testing**

- **DynamicConfigOperationsTest**: These tests verify the functionality of utility classes that provide essential support, such as dynamic configuration management, polling mechanisms, and failover strategies. They ensure these utilities operate consistently across various scenarios, underpinning the application's operational reliability.

## 2.3 Running Environment

To ensure a smooth execution of the tests, please meet the following prerequisites:

- **Java 17** or newer must be installed.
- **Git** must be installed.
- **Docker** is optional but recommended for those who prefer running tests within containers.

If opting to use Docker, the backend will be containerized based on a Docker image. To set up the backend environment and run the tests, execute the following shell command:

```
./mvnw clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Pprod
```

This command builds the project and skips the test phase, primarily used for production builds. For testing purposes, especially when you want to execute all the test cases, use the following Maven command:

```
mvn clean test
```

This command cleans the **`target`** directory, compiles the source code, and runs all tests in the **`src/test/java`** directory against the compiled code.

## 2.4 Managing and Analyzing Test Reports

When faced with numerous report files, we can employ text search tools to locate files containing specific keywords, such as "ERROR". This approach facilitates quick identification of problematic tests.

For Linux and macOS, the **`grep`** command can be utilized:

```
grep -i "ERROR" /Users/yiren/Documents/GitHub/kafka-ui/kafka-ui-api/target/surefire-reports/*.txt

```

On Windows, the **`findstr`** command serves a similar purpose. These commands list all occurrences of the keyword "ERROR" across the test reports, aiding in the rapid identification of issues.

**Viewing and Addressing Failed Tests:**

- **Review Detailed Test Reports**: For each failed test, the Surefire plugin generates a detailed report file within the **`target/surefire-reports`** directory for the corresponding test class. It's important to locate the **`.txt`** report files associated with the failed tests identified, such as **`com.provectus.kafka.ui.KafkaConsumerGroupTests.txt`** and **`com.provectus.kafka.ui.emitter.MessageFiltersTest$GroovyScriptFilter.txt`**. These report files contain the names of the failed test methods, reasons for the failures, and detailed stack traces. This information is crucial for pinpointing the source of the problem and facilitating effective troubleshooting.


# Part III. Functional testing and partition testing

## 3.1Functional Testing

Functional Testing is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose of Functional tests is to test each function of the software application, by providing appropriate input, verifying the output against the Functional requirements.

Functional testing mainly involves black box testing and it is not concerned about the source code of the application. This testing checks User Interface, APIs, Database, Security, Client/Server communication and other functionality of the Application Under Test. The testing can be done either manually or using automation.

#### Purpose of functional testing
- Ensuring Correct Functionality

Systematic functional testing is essential to ensure that the software functions correctly according to its specifications and requirements. This helps in delivering a product that meets user expectations.

- Comprehensive Coverage

Systematic functional testing aims to provide comprehensive coverage of the entire application. This includes testing individual units, ensuring proper integration, and validating the system as a whole.

- Building User Confidence

Thorough functional testing builds confidence among users and stakeholders, assuring them that the software not only works but works reliably under various conditions.


## 3.2 Partition Testing

Partition Testing is a software testing technique that divides the input data of a software unit into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived. In principle, test cases are designed to cover each partition at least once. This technique tries to define test cases that uncover classes of errors, thereby reducing the total number of test cases that must be developed. An advantage of this approach is reduction in the time required for testing software due to lesser number of test cases. 

#### Purpose of partition testing
- Efficient Testing

Partition testing allows for efficient testing by dividing the input space into equivalence classes. This reduces the number of test cases needed while ensuring that each class is adequately represented.

- Identifying Critical Input Scenarios

Not all possible inputs need to be tested individually. Partition testing helps identify critical input scenarios, allowing testers to focus on representative values that are likely to reveal defects.

- Identifying Defects Associated with Input Classes

Defects often cluster around specific input classes. Partition testing aids in identifying and addressing issues associated with different input partitions, contributing to improved software reliability.

### The feature for partition testing

We chose the class `Int32Serde` implemented at "kafka-ui-api/src/main/java/com/provectus/kafka/ui/serdes/builtin/Int32Serde.java".
It deals with serialization and deserialization of a 32-bit integer.
It implemented interface `BuiltInSerde` at "kafka-ui-api/src/main/java/com/provectus/kafka/ui/serdes/BuiltInSerde.java", which extends another interface `Serde` at "kafka-ui-serde-api/src/main/java/com/provectus/kafka/ui/serde/api/Serde.java".

### New partition tests
The input space of this feature is 32-bit integers in the form of string.
We partitioned the input space into 4 parts based on the nature of integers: zero, positive integer[1, 2147483647], negative integer[-2147483648, -1], invalid input (including all integers beyond the scope [-2147483648, 2147483647] and all invalid string that does not represent an integer).

We chose number "1234" and "2147483647" to represent the positive integer partition, number "-2147483648" to represent the negative partition and chose "null" and "2147483648" to represent invalid input. 
We included both boundaries and random representative values to cover all partitions and make sure the feature is stable at boundaries.
For valid input, after serialization and deserialization, the value should be the same. For invalid input, an exception should be thrown.

New test cases and their documents were included in "kafka-ui-api/src/test/java/com/provectus/kafka/ui/serdes/builtin/Int32SerdeTest.java". To run all JUnit tests, use the command "mvn clean test".
